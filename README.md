# Sensing-Data-Protocol
A protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sani- tization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifac
